# Map-Search-Engine
A search engine using google maps and the fusion table layer to show searchable points on a map

Setup:
  Before using this code you must create a Google FusionTable with at least two columns (Name and location).
  This table must be publicly available for you to use this code.

Index.html:
  In this file there are to place holder values xxxxx and y. 
  xxxxx is your tableId. 
  y is the name of the column you are putting into the table (not the location column).

style.css:
  This is not particularly integral to the application and can be modified or deleted.
